As a self-proclaimed tech nerd, I bring over 15 years of Information Technology expertise to the table. As a network
and systems administrator turned Cybersecurity Engineer, I have administered and secured infrastructures in
healthcare, finance, and other highly regulated industries along with small/medium business and state/county/local
government agencies. My passions in Cybersecurity is finding misconfigurations and vulnerabilities before the bad
guys do, staying on top of the latest cybersecurity advancements and sharing my knowledge with others.
