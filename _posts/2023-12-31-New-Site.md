Hello World! The past 18 years have been quite the technology journey since first entering the IT industry as
a "general administrator (network & systems)" for a small MSP in the northern panhandle of West Virginia in
late 2005.

In 2024, I am excited to share my experiences, the highlights, and lowlights alike, in one centralized place.
I hope to engage techies and non-techies alike, with insightful reflections, knowledge sharing, and maybe
some humor, and try to make even complex concepts approachable.

I have always believed that learning is enhanced when guided by the wisdom of past triumphs and trials,
when the jokes of “Testing in Prod” become reality, taking pride in failures, and feeling accomplished when
breaking something is your best teacher.
