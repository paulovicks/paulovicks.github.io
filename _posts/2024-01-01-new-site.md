Hello World! After reorganizing my documentation, I realized the need for a centralized documentation repository.

I have chosen to use GitHub Pages with a custom domain and Jekyll theme blog system for this process. I will be
sharing information about various topics, mostly related to information technology, as well as general information
that I find interesting and random rants.
