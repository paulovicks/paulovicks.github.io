Hello World! The past 18 years have been quite the technology journey since first entering the IT industry way-back
in late 2005 as a "general administrator (network & systems)" for a small MSP in the northern panhandle of West
Virginia. Now, in 2024, I am excited to share my experiences, the highlights and lowlights alike,  in one
centralized place. My hope is to engage techies and non-techies alike, with insightful reflections, knowledge
sharing, maybe some humor, and try to make even complex concepts approachable. I have always believed that
learning is enhanced when guided by the wisdom of past triumphs and trials, when the jokes of “Testing in Prod”
becomes reality, taking pride in failures and feeling accomplished when breaking something is your best teacher.
